So_Long is the fifth project in the 42 School curriculum, offering me an exciting opportunity to combine my passion for gaming with my coding skills. Based on the MinilibX graphics library, So_Long challenges me to create a simple 2D game environment where a player navigates through a maze while encountering obstacles and collecting items.

This repository contains my implementation of the So_Long project, reflecting my enthusiasm for gaming and my dedication to honing my coding skills for game development. By choosing So_Long among the three available projects based on MinilibX, I've demonstrated my commitment to leveraging my coding expertise in the realm of gaming.

Embarking on an adventure in game development, I'll explore the intricacies of graphics rendering, user interaction, and game logic. With So_Long, I'll delve into the fundamentals of game design while mastering the technical aspects of building interactive experiences.
